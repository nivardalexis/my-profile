				<h1>Travel experiences</h1>
				<p>
					I've been lucky enough to travel to different countries:
				</p>	
				<h2 class="list-title">China</h2>		
				<p>
					I stayed there for 4 years, to do a bachelor degree
				</p>
				<h2 class="list-title">Uzbekistan</h2>	
				<p>
					I stayed there for 2 weeks, visit my friends and enjoy the local food
				</p>
				<h2 class="list-title">Kyrgistan</h2>	
				<p>
					It is my old roommate's country, so I had the chance to go there very often. The landscape there is very beautiful, they have huge mountains and one of the biggest lake in the world
